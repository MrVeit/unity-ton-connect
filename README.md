# UNITON CONNECT

I'm familiar with your problem where you tried the available libraries to integrate Ton Connect 2.0 into Unity, but it was inconvenient or simply impossible due to poor implementation by their authors.

It's time to come to the bright side - Uniton Connect!
It's an sdk with a user-frendly API for connecting TON wallets natively into web applications on Unity and beyond.
